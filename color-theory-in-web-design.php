            <h4 class="blog-post-title mt-5">Color theory basics</h4>
            <p class="blog-post-meta text-justify">
              A collection of principles termed color theory assists designers in comprehending how colors are incorporated into the design. The primary, secondary, and tertiary colors are represented visually on the color wheel, which is the foundation of this system. Red, blue, and yellow are the primary colors, while green, orange, and purple are the secondary colors. By blending the primary and secondary hues, the tertiary colors are produced.

            <p class="blog-post-meta text-justify">
              Color Harmonies are combinations of colors defined by the color theory that go well together.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-post-meta text-justify">
              The three basic and standard color harmonies are triadic, analogous, and complimentary.

            <ul>
              <li><strong class="font-weight-bold">Complementary hues </strong>oppose one another and produce a strong contrast impression.</li>
              <li><strong class="font-weight-bold">Analogous hues </strong>are close to one another and provide a relaxing, harmonizing effect.</li>
              <li><strong class="font-weight-bold">Triadic hues </strong>are uniformly spaced apart and provide a vivid, energizing effect.</li>

              Now that you understand the basics of color theory, let's explore how you can use it in web design.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong class="font-weight-bold">Make a color palette: </strong>Creating a color palette is the first step in applying color theory to web design. A color scheme is a collection of hues you'll use on your website. While deciding on a color scheme, consider the feelings and atmosphere you wish to express. For instance, you may use a color scheme of blues and greens to create a calming and friendly website. You may use a color scheme of vivid, intense hues if you want to build a website that is lively and active.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong class="font-weight-bold">Employ color to direct users: </strong>You may use color to direct visitors to your website. You may choose a different color to make your call-to-action button stand out and entice people to click it. Also, you may utilize color to draw attention to something special, like a deal or promotion.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong class="font-weight-bold">Think about Accessibility: </strong>Color impacts accessibility, which is a crucial factor in web design. Ensure the color contrast between the text and backdrop is strong enough for visually impaired individuals to read it easily. You may examine the contrast of your color choices with tools like WebAIM's Contrast Checker.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong class="font-weight-bold">Be consistent: </strong>In web design, consistency is essential, and this rule also applies to color. Use your color scheme consistently throughout to give your website a polished appearance.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong class="font-weight-bold">Ensure simplicity: </strong>Lastly, remember that when it comes to color in web design, less is sometimes more. Avoid making your website excessively colorful since people may find it overpowering. Instead, pick a few complementary hues and strategically include them in other parts of your website.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="blog-post-title mt-5">Conclusion</h4>
