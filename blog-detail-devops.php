                DevOps is a combination of two essential business terms ‘Development’ and ‘operations.’ Traditionally software development consists of two department <strong>Development Team</strong> and<strong> Operations Team</strong>. The development team conceptualizes the idea and builds it from the ground up. On the other hand, the operations team is responsible for testing and implementing the developed product. The operations team also gives feedback to the development team on the bugs and errors that need rectification. Inevitably the development team always has to sit idle and wait for input from the operations team, which leads to extended timelines and delays in the software development cycle. DevOps was born to eliminate this communication barrier between the development and operations teams and avoid delays in the software development cycle. It is the coming together of the Development and the Operations team to maximize growth, efficiency, and productivity. It is a combination of business strategies and advanced automation technologies to replace slow and conventional software development for the production of better, more functional, and faster applications and services. DevOps is all about speed, efficiency, and delivering the best value in the least time.

                When you think of DevOps culture, you can imagine a workplace where everything is happening simultaneously in real-time. The fundamental attributes of DevOps are continuous delivery, seamless integration, and process automation. These attributes make it a mitigative approach with higher scalability, stability, and lesser resource consumption.

Continuous testing is an essential element of DevOps in which a product is evaluated throughout the ongoing delivery process. Continuous testing takes our source code, builds it, tests it using different testing tools, and eventually deploys it into the respective server. Some tools used for continuous testing are Maven, TestNG, and Jenkins.
