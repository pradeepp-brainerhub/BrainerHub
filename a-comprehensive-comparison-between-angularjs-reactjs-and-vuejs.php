            <h4 class="blog-post-title mt-5">AngularJs</h4>
            <p class="blog-post-meta text-justify">
              Angular is one of the most prepared JavaScript frameworks used by millions of developers worldwide. The popularity of Angular is most due to its distinguished structure, including easy two-way data binding, an MVC model, a built-in module system routing packages, dependency injection, and other practical and effective features.
            </p>
            <h4 class="blog-post-title">ReactJS</h4>
            <p class="blog-post-meta text-justify">
              For the development of large online apps which can update data without refreshing a webpage, the frontend library React is used to build domain-specific, interchangeable, and integrated UI components. The primary objectives of ReactJS are to be intuitive, versatile, and efficient. React doesn't implement the MVC template because it is a front-end framework, but you may think of it as the view component of it.
            </p>
            <h4 class="blog-post-title">VueJS</h4>
            <p class="blog-post-meta text-justify">
              Vue is a dynamic and modern framework for creating interface design, according to the usual definition. In contrast to Angular, which is a homogeneous framework, Vue was designed to be gradually adopted by users. Thanks to its capabilities, relatively simple learning period, and capacity for producing effective, quick, and complex single-page apps, it has become one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks. Vue and react are pretty similar because of their identical objectives.
