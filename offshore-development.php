                        <p>This model is more suitable for large enterprises. For instance, General Electric opened its ODC services in India 25 years ago.</p>
                        <p>In the customer model, the ODC operates as a subsidiary of the main company. All team members are full employees of your organization, with the only major difference being that the project is operating from a different location. There is an on-site group of senior employees to conduct management functions and make all key decisions. The development, testing, and execution are provided by the local experts. A typical structure for the customer model may look like this: </p>

                        <h3>Contractor model</h3>
                        <p>In this model, offshore experts are not full employees of your organization, which lets you save on overhead costs from salaries. Based on the requirement, you can easily hire specific experts for the subprojects and remove them when their services are no longer needed. To illustrate a typical contractor model, take a look at this picture: </p>
                        <p>Although this model is more suitable for start-ups and small and mid-sized companies, it can be leveraged by large corporations as well. In this format of collaboration, the in-house product or engineering managers communicate with the project manager at the ODC. All tasks are performed by the offshore team and reported back to the headquarters. With this approach, you can focus on the marketing of your product or working with your in-house teams, while the ODC will execute a certain part in the product development. </p>

                     <p>Although both terms are often used interchangeably, there are distinct differences between the two—let’s break them down! </p>
                     <p>With IT outsourcing, external specialists are hired to boost the development and deployment of your software solutions, quickly scale up the project, and achieve higher cost-efficiency. These experts continue to be the employees of your software development partner and work with you only for the duration of a certain project. Your partner is responsible for meeting the deadlines and achieving targets. When the project is completed, the development team moves on to the next project set by your vendor. </p>
                     <p>Thus, hiring an outsourced team is a great choice for one-time projects, for example creating a website or Proof of Concept and MVP development.</p>
                     <p>In a customer model ODC, you are the employer of the entire team, as they are a part of your company. Nonetheless, you may need help from a local technology partner to form the team and set up an office. Your actions will tend to be more committed compared to people who work with you on a temporary basis, and the results will depend on your team’s efforts. When a certain project is complete, you will need to decide what to do with your employees.</p>

                        <h3>Passion</h3>
                        <p>Being a part of the project, software developers working for product companies typically show more dedication and interest in the outcome of the project. With the ODC approach, you have higher chances of attracting people with a product mindset who thrive on being a part of something great. That said, you can have outsourcing developers with a high level of commitment too, but you can certainly expect more passion from employees with an ODC. </p>

                        <p>The outsourcing option is probably cheaper, but with a limitation that your project is not going to scale much. The ODC requires up-front investments and additional time to assemble a team of experts and set up a properly functional office; however, in the long run, you can expect a higher Return On Investments (ROI) from it.

For instance, if you are from the USA and want to set up an R&D center in Ukraine, Poland, Romania, or any other country in Eastern Europe, it could prove to be a better idea, from the cultural perspective, compared to opening your office in Asia. It does not imply that everything will run smoothly, but any possible friction from a cultural standpoint will be reduced. </p>

To mitigate risks and prevent any leakage of sensitive information, network security must be built into the infrastructure of your ODC. Additionally, you can conduct regular security audits and risk assessments to deal with security challenges specific to your situation. </p>

                        <h3>Conduct research and analysis </h3>
                        <p>First and foremost, you need to know whether an ODC is a good fit for your organization at all. Consider other options of outsourcing like the Dedicated Development Team model, Managed Services, and others. Make sure that the infrastructure of your organization is ready for collaboration with an offshoring partner if you choose to go with the contractor model. Finally, know exactly why you cannot meet your software development needs locally and what expertise you require before you consider an ODC. </p>

                        <h3>Select location </h3>
                        <p>There is a multitude of factors that attract companies to establish their ODC’s, including lower salaries and operational costs, accomplished technical skills, suitable time zones, and cultural similarities. Later in the article, we will discuss rates by country to provide you with a better understanding. </p>

                        <h3>Find a partner </h3>
                        <p>With a contractor model, you will need to find a trusted software development company to represent your organization in a foreign country. Likewise, with a customer model, you may require a local partner for setting up your office and helping you navigate through local legislation, business, and political situation, or you may choose to do it with the help of your existing team. </p>

                        <h3>Start the recruitment process </h3>
                        <p>Whether your team is in charge of recruiting or you seek help from a local partner, you will require skilled experts in your new location. Some companies consider it imperative to enter a new market using their own brand. With the ODC model, hiring people under your brand who will work within your corporate policies can be an additional benefit. Professionals are more likely to join an established and well-known organization compared to joining a less renowned software development partner.</p>
